Operators is another tool that is provided by almost all programming languages.
<TT>lci</TT> supports operators as a special kind of function that takes two arguments
and syntactically appears between them. Using an operator requires two steps.
The first is it's <EM>declaration</EM> together with it's <EM>precedece</EM> and
<EM>associativity</EM>, in a way similar to Prolog. This can be done with the command
</P><DIV CLASS="center">
	<TT>DefOp 'operator' preced assoc</TT>
</DIV><P>
Quotes are necessary so that operator's name is recognized as an identifier. Precedence
is an integer between 0 and 255 and is used during parsing when no parentheses
are present. Associativity takes one of the following values:
</P><DIV CLASS="center">
	<TABLE CELLSPACING=6 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=center NOWRAP>		<TT>yfx</TT></TD><TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP>Left-associative operator</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=center NOWRAP>		<TT>xfy</TT></TD><TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP>Right-associative operator</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=center NOWRAP>		<TT>xfx</TT></TD><TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP>Non-associative operator</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV><P>Character <TT>x</TT> corresponds to a term with lower precedence than the operator,
while <TT>y</TT> to one with higher or equal. Thus expression <TT>a+b+c*d</TT>
will be recognized as <TT>(a+b)+(c*d)</TT>, for operator <TT>*</TT> has lower precedence
<SUP><A NAME="text1" HREF="lcidoc010.html#note1">1</A></SUP>
than <TT>+</TT> and <TT>+</TT> is left-associative. Terms that are not the result of
an operator, or are enclosed in parentheses, are considered to have precedence 0.
Moreover application is considered as a left-associative operator with precedence
100. So if an operator <TT>$</TT> is declared with precedence 110 then the
expression <TT>a b$c</TT> will be recognized as <TT>(a b)$c</TT>.</P><P>The second step is operator's <EM>definition</EM> which is performed by defining an
alias with the same name:
</P><DIV CLASS="center">
	<TT>'operator' = ...</TT>
</DIV><P>
Operator definitions must be placed in a file (as all alias definitions) and quotes
are required. During parsing, <TT>lci</TT> replaces operators with identifiers, thas is
expression <TT>a+b</TT> will be transformed to <TT>'+' a b</TT>. Now <TT>+</TT> is an
identifier, not an operator, and will be replaced with the corresponding term
during term's evaluation.</P><P>In <TT>.lcirc</TT> many common operators are declared and defined, mainly concerning
integers and list manipulation. These include the right-associative
operator <TT>:</TT> to write lists as <TT>a:b:c:Nil</TT>, operator <TT>++</TT> to append
lists, operator &#X201C;<TT>,</TT>&#X201D; to build ordered pairs <TT>(a,b)</TT>, integer operations,
integer comparisons etc.</P><HR>
