	* NEWS 1.1:
		Added NEWS file with info about the 0.5 release.

	* .cvsignore 1.1:
	* doc/.cvsignore 1.1:
	* src/.cvsignore 1.1:
		Added .cvsignore in all directories.

	* TODO 1.2:
		Marked autotools and readline goals as done.

	* README 1.2:
		- updated installation paragraph
		- fixed some typos

	* AUTHORS 1.1:
		Added AUTHORS file

	* Makefile 1.2:
	* Makefile.am 1.1:
	* configure.ac 1.1:
	* doc/Makefile 1.2:
	* doc/Makefile.am 1.1:
	* reconf 1.1:
	* src/Makefile 1.3:
	* src/Makefile.am 1.1:
		Use autotools build system
		- added configure.ac
		- added Makefile.am files in every directory
		- added reconf script to run autoconf/automake/etc
		- removed old Makefiles

	* doc/lcidoc_gr.tex 1.2:
		fixed typos

	* doc/lcidoc.tex 1.3:
		- Explain the directories where .lcirc file is searched
		- minor corrections

	* src/termproc.c 1.3:
	* src/termproc.h 1.2:
		- use autotools
		- use a memory pool for fast term creation
		  * termFree(): stores the term in the pool instead of really free() it
		  * termNew(): returns a term from the pool, uses malloc() only
		      if pool is empty
		  * termGC(): free()s all terms in the pool
		  * use termNew/termFree everywhere instead of malloc/free
		- termSubst()
		  * Added a mustClone argument. If 0 then the term N is not cloned
		    but used directly in the substitution. M[x=N] can be performed without
		    cloning if x appears at most once in M.
		  * return 1 if x was actually substituted with N in M
		           0 if no occurance of x was found.
		- big optimization using closed flag
		  * TERM struct contains a 'closed' field
		  * termSetClosedFlag(), termFreeVars(): update the closed flag of
		      all subterms of the given term. Called before executing a term.
		  * termSubst(), termConv(): closed flags are kept updated during
		      conversions with minimum complexity cost (constant time).
		      It is not always possible to detect that a term became closed without
		      cost, so a term marked as non-closed could in fact be closed. But the
		      opposite should hold, terms marked as closed MUST be closed.
		  * termSubst(), termIsFreeVar(): closed flags are used to avoid examining
		      closed terms (which have no free variables and no substitution
		      is possible)
		- with the above optimizations we solve Queens 5 in 2 seconds instead of 50
		  and Queens 6 in 40 seconds which before was unsolvable in reasonable time.

	* src/kazlib/list.c 1.1:
	* src/kazlib/list.h 1.1:
		Added linked list implementation from kazlib
		http://users.footprints.net/~kaz/kazlib.html

	* src/decllist.c 1.2:
	* src/decllist.h 1.2:
		- use autotools
		- removeCycle(): call termSetClosedFlag() on newly created terms
		- use termNew() instead of malloc() to create new terms

	* src/grammar.c 1.2:
		- use autotools
		- call termSetClosedFlag() on alias definitions. produce an error if the term is not closed.
		- use termNew() instead of malloc() to create new terms

	* src/grammar.h 1.2:
		- use autotools
		- reduced sizeof(TERM) by
		  * using __atribute__((packed)) to make enums in TERM stucture use just one byte
		  * reordering the structure's fields so that bigger fields are on top, allowing the compiler to align the data without leaving holes

	* src/parser.c 1.2:
	* src/parser.h 1.2:
		- use autotools
		- bugfix: when accessing charNo array, convert index to unsigned char. The signed value was negative for the greek lambda character (\xEB) leading to writing outside the array which gave a bus error in OSX.

	* src/run.c 1.3:
	* src/run.h 1.3:
		- use autotools
		- use readline for single character input in trace mode
		  (fallback to IOCTL or standard C lib if readline not available)
		- execTerm(): return 1 if Quit was given
		- execSystemCmd(): return -2 if Quit was given

	* src/main.c 1.3:
		- use autotools
		- use readline for line input
		- use readline for history (save session to ~/.lci_history)
		- read datadir/lci/.lcirc and $home/.lcirc in addition to ./.lcirc

2004-01-27 12:17  hatz

	* src/Makefile: Added -fno-strict-aliasing flag to avoid some
	  warnings.

2004-01-27 11:47  hatz

	* src/main.c: Replaced the 'dangerous' gets by fgets.

2004-01-26 18:31  hatz

	* doc/lcidoc.tex: Updated documentation for the change of the way
	  terms are printed.

2004-01-26 17:54  hatz

	* src/: run.c, run.h, termproc.c: Changed the way lambda terms are
	  printed: replaced greek lambda with "." because it is not
	  available in most character sets. It can be enabled with the
	  greeklambda option. Removed haskell option.
