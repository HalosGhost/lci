LCI - Real men use only pure calculus

0.6 (21 Sep 2006):
	This is a bugfix release which corrects a bug (#1546641) in alpha-conversion. The bug
	was affecting the power operator (**) giving a wrong result in some cases.

0.5 (13 Mar 2006):
	First 'official' release of lci, the code was there for some time but
	I wanted to add an autotooled build system and some cool extra features.

	So we now use autotools to build, type ./configure && make && make install
	and you're done. Tested in linux, win32 (cygwin) and OSX, it compiles like a charm :)

	There is also support for readline now so if you have it installed when
	compiling you'll be able to edit the lines that you type, have history, etc.

	Finally some impressive optimizations have been done in this version.
	Queens 5 takes just 2 seconds instead of 50 and we can even solve Queens 6
	in 40 seconds which was unsolvable before.

	Enjoy!
