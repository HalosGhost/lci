<div class="header">What is LCI?</div>
LCI is an interpreter for the lambda calculus.  It supports many advanced
features like recursion, user-defined operators and multiple evaluation strategies,
all based on the pure calculus. It is FREE SOFTWARE licenced under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public Licence</a>
(GPL).

	<b><a href="javascript:toggleNews(2);">Version 0.6 - Development site</a></b> (14 February 2008)<br>
	<div id="news2">
		This is a bugfix release, correcting an issue with alpha conversion that was causing the exponential
		operator (**) to give wrong results (the fix was in cvs for a long time). This version also
		coincides with the setup of a <a href="http://trac2.assembla.com/lci/wiki">development site</a> for LCI
		that uses <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>. It will make it easier for people
		to send bug reports, feature requests, etc, and hopefully bring forth some activity in the project.

	<b><a href="javascript:toggleNews(1);">Version 0.5 is out</a></b> (13 March 2006)<br>
	<div id="news1" style="display:none">
	First 'official' release of lci, the code was there for some time but
	I wanted to add an autotooled build system and some cool extra features.
	<br><br>
	So we now use autotools to build, type ./configure && make && make install
	and you're done. Tested in linux, win32 (cygwin) and OSX, it compiles like a charm :)
	<br><br>
	There is also support for <a href="http://tiswww.tis.case.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html">readline</a>
	now so if you have it installed when compiling you'll be able to edit the lines
	that you type, have history, etc.
	<br><br>
	Finally some impressive optimizations have been done in this version.
	Queens 5 takes just 2 seconds instead of 50 and we can even solve Queens 6
	and Queens 7 which were unsolvable before.
	<br><br>
	Enjoy :)

<div class="header">Download</div>
Latest version is 0.6, released on 14 February 2008. You can install LCI from source
(recommended for Linux and OSX) or you can use the pre-compiled i386 binaries for Linux and Windows.<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lci/lci-0.6.tar.gz?download">Source code</a> (tar.gz, 200KB)</li>
  <li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lci/lci-0.6-linux-i386.tar.gz?download">Linux binaries</a> (tar.gz, 570KB)</li>
  <li><a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lci/lci-0.6-win32.zip?download">Windows binaries</a> (zip, 1MB)</li>
</ul>
<br>
To install LCI from source extract the source archive, cd to that directory and
type
<pre>
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install
</pre>
It is recommended to install the readline library (and development files) before
compiling LCI. For debian based systems the package is called <tt>libreadline5-dev</tt>.
Check the output of <tt>configure</tt> to see if you have it.
<br><br>
To use a binary package simply extract it and run the <tt>lci</tt> executable.
<br><br>
You can also get the latest development version directly from subversion (make
sure to read the README):
<pre>
   svn checkout http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/lci/trunk lci
</pre>

<a name="documentation">
<div class="header">Documentation</div>
There is a detailed enough documentation of LCI in pdf format. The documentation 
covers most of the program's features and it also explains various topics concerning 
the lambda-calculus 
<ul>
  <li><a href="doc/index.html">View</a> documentation online.</li>
  <li><a href="lcidoc.pdf">Download</a> documentation (pdf, 89KB)<br>

<div class="header">Development - Contribution</div>

If you find bugs in LCI please <b>add a ticket</b> at LCI's <a
	href="http://trac2.assembla.com/lci/wiki">development site</a>. Tickets can
be also added to suggest new features or to ask for support. You can also see
development information, subversion activity, browse the source code, etc.
If you are interested in helping to improve LCI by contributing code or joining the development team 
(in order to really become a &quot;team&quot; ;-) you are something more than 
welcome.
<br><br>
Finally I'd like very much to hear from people who are actually <b>using</b>
the program, feel free to mail me for any reason.
